    "The Ford F-150 is a full-size pickup truck known for its versatility, power, and towing capacity. It is available in various configurations, including different engine options, bed lengths, and trim levels. The F-150 is a great choice for those who need a truck for heavy-duty work, towing trailers, or carrying large loads. It offers a spacious interior and advanced technology features for a comfortable driving experience.\n",

    "On the other hand, the Ford Ranger is a midsize pickup truck that is more compact than the F-150. The Ranger is known for its maneuverability, fuel efficiency, and off-road capabilities. It is a versatile truck suitable for everyday driving, light towing, and outdoor adventures. The Ranger offers a smaller footprint compared to the F-150, making it easier to navigate in urban areas and tight spaces.\n",

    "In summary, the main differences between the Ford F-150 and Ford Ranger lie in their size, towing capacity, and intended use.

However, if you prefer a more compact and agile truck for everyday driving and light towing, the Ranger could be a great option.\n",
